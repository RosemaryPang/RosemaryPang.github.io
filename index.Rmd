I am a faculty fellow in [Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Program](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/data-analytics-and-computational-social-science-program/about) (DACSS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I received my doctoral degree from the [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu/) dual program at the Pennsylvania State University in 2022. Prior to arriving at Penn State, I got a master's degree from [Purdue University](https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/) and a bachelor's degree from the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/humanities-and-social-sciences/schools-and-department/international-studies/home.aspx).

My substantive research and teaching interests are in the <b>politics in autocracies</b>, with a current focus on <b>party institutionalization</b> and <b>corruption</b>. While I conduct research on authoritarian regimes from a comparative perspective, I have specific expertise in <b>Chinese Politics</b>. Methodologically, my research focuses on computational social science, natural language processing in English and Chinese (e.g., text mining, quantitative text analysis), measurement, and survey analysis.
