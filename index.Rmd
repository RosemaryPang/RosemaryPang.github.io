I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu/) dual program at the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to arriving at Penn State, I got a master degree from [Purdue University](https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/) and a bachelor's degree from the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/internationalstudies/home.aspx). I expect to graduate in <b> May 2021 </b>.

I study the politics in autocracies with a current focus on <b>party institutionalization</b> and <b>corruption</b>. While conducting research on authoritarian regimes from a comparative perspective, I have specific expertise in Chinese Politics. Methodologically, my research focuses on computational social science, natural language process in English and Chinese (e.g. text mining, quantitative text analysis), and measurement.
